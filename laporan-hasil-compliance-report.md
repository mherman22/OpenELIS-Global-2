# Laporan Hasil — Compliance Report (Sertifikat Hasil Uji)

## Functional Requirements Specification — v1.0 (amended 2026-04-28)

**Version:** 1.0 (amended in place 2026-04-28) **Date:** 2026-04-05 · amended
2026-04-28 **Status:** Draft for Review **Jira:**
[OGC-552](https://uwdigi.atlassian.net/browse/OGC-552) (under Vector epic
[OGC-527](https://uwdigi.atlassian.net/browse/OGC-527))

> **⚠️ 2026-04-28 amendment — multi-regulation + multi-component rendering.**
> S-03 v2.0 was amended same day to support ≥1 compliance standard per order via
> the `order_compliance_standard` join. S-05 v2.0 was amended to evaluate per
> regulation × component. This certificate spec amends accordingly:
>
> - **Header lists all selected regulations** in `selectionOrder` from the
>   order's `order_compliance_standard` join. Each regulation gets its own
>   header line: regulation number (monospace) + standard name + issuing body +
>   version. No "primary" — they're stacked equally.
> - **Per-result section**: each result row shows compliance per regulation as a
>   small grouped pattern. Visual: per-result table cell renders
>   `[PP 22/2021: ✓ Pass · ≤25 NTU] [WHO-DWG-4: ⚠ Marginal · ≤5 NTU]`. If a
>   regulation has no applicable threshold for that test, render
>   `[WHO-DWG-4: — no threshold]` in muted text. Mirrors S-05 v2.0 §4.4
>   threshold-source list and §4.5 inline indicator patterns.
> - **Multi-component tests** render one row per (test, component) — the
>   existing single-row-per-result rendering generalizes. Component label
>   appears as a sub-row indent. Each component evaluates independently per
>   regulation.
> - **Repeated readings** (e.g., noise survey with N readings around a building)
>   render as a sub-table grouped by `reading_group_id`. Each reading shows its
>   own component values + per-regulation flags.
> - **QC Summary section** unchanged from S-08 v2.0 amendment — sits below the
>   per-result section, lists batch QC samples + their evaluation outcomes.
>   Independent of the multi-regulation amendment.
>
> Data contract additions: report generator reads `order_compliance_standard`
> rows for the header, and for each result reads the list of (flag, source)
> tuples returned by S-05 v2.0's evaluator (one per applicable regulation ×
> component). **Technology:** Java Spring Framework, Carbon React
> (`@carbon/react`), PDF generation (server-side) **Related Modules:**
> Compliance Standards Administration (S-01, OGC-528), Sampling Site Registry
> (S-02, OGC-531), Environmental Order Entry (S-03, OGC-537), Compliance
> Evaluation Engine (S-05, OGC-547), Report-Level Electronic Signatures, Patient
> Report Print Queue

## 1. Executive Summary

The Laporan Hasil (S-06) adds a formal compliance report generation capability
to OpenELIS Global, completing the end-to-end environmental compliance workflow:
order → test → evaluate → report. When all results on an environmental order
have been validated and released, the order becomes eligible for Sertifikat
Hasil Uji (Test Results Certificate) generation — a formal PDF document matching
Indonesian regulatory requirements under PP No. 22/2021 and KAN/ISO 17025
accreditation standards.

The feature introduces two components. First, a shared **Report Print
Configuration** admin page (Admin → Report Configuration) where lab
administrators configure header/footer elements — lab name, logo, accreditation
number, address, page numbering, and footer text — that are inherited by the
Laporan Hasil and can be consumed by all other printed reports in the system.
Second, a dedicated **Reports → Laporan Hasil** page where users filter eligible
orders by date range, site, standard, and compliance status, then generate
individual certificate PDFs or batch-download a ZIP of multiple certificates.

Each certificate includes a header block (lab identity from shared config),
sample information (from `complianceContext`), a results table with compliance
evaluations (from `ComplianceEvaluation` records), an overall compliance
conclusion, and a dual e-signature block (Tested by / Validated and Released by)
using the existing electronic signature infrastructure.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

**Current state:** OpenELIS Global has no mechanism to produce formal compliance
test certificates for environmental samples. After a technician enters results
and a validator releases them, the compliance evaluation data exists in the
database (via S-05) but there is no way to generate the official regulatory
document that Indonesian labs must provide to clients, regulators, and
accreditation bodies. Additionally, there is no centralized configuration for
common report elements (lab name, logo, accreditation number) — each report
template currently hardcodes or independently manages these values.

**Impact:** Without automated certificate generation, lab staff must manually
transcribe validated results into external templates (Word, Excel, or paper
forms). This is slow, error-prone, and breaks the audit trail. It also means the
compliance evaluation data computed by S-05 is not reflected on the official
document. KAN-accredited environmental labs (ISO 17025) are required to produce
traceable, reproducible test certificates with electronic signatures — manual
transcription fails this requirement. The lack of shared print configuration
means that when lab details change (new accreditation number, address update),
every report template must be updated independently.

**Proposed solution:** A dedicated report generation page under Reports →
Laporan Hasil that queries fully-validated environmental orders, presents them
in a filterable DataTable, and generates formal Sertifikat Hasil Uji PDFs on
demand. The PDF layout follows Indonesian regulatory conventions and pulls
header/footer elements from a new shared Report Print Configuration.
E-signatures are rendered using the existing electronic signature data model. A
shared admin page for print configuration ensures lab identity is managed in one
place and inherited by all reports.

## 3. Scope & Non-Goals

### 3.1 In Scope

- Shared Report Print Configuration (Admin → Report Configuration) for lab
  identity, logo, accreditation, header/footer elements
- Report generation page (Reports → Laporan Hasil) with filters and batch
  selection
- PDF generation of individual Sertifikat Hasil Uji per order
- PDF structure: header, sample info, regulatory reference, results table,
  compliance conclusion, e-signature block
- E-signature integration using existing `electronic_signature` table
- Batch PDF generation producing a ZIP file of individual certificates
- Generation audit trail (who generated, when, which orders)
- Report numbering (sequential certificate number per site per year)

### 3.2 Non-Goals

- **3.2.1** Inline PDF preview/renderer in the browser — user downloads and
  opens in their PDF viewer
- **3.2.2** Consolidated multi-order reports — each order produces one PDF
- **3.2.3** Email/distribution workflow — future enhancement
- **3.2.4** Report template customization UI — future enhancement (v1.0 uses a
  fixed layout)
- **3.2.5** Non-environmental reports — the Laporan Hasil page only handles
  environmental compliance certificates. Clinical patient reports use the
  existing Patient Report pipeline.
- **3.2.6** Cryptographic PDF signing (PKI) — out of scope per the existing
  e-signature spec
- **3.2.7** Re-generation restrictions — users may regenerate a certificate at
  any time (each generation is logged)

| Tests           | Count of tests on the order                                                     | No                 |
| Compliance      | Aggregate status: "All Compliant" (green Tag), "Issues Found" (red Tag), counts | No                 |
| Last Generated  | Timestamp of most recent PDF generation, or "—" if never                        | Yes                |
| Actions         | "Generate PDF" button                                                           | —                  |

**LH-2-005:** The DataTable SHALL support Carbon batch actions via
`TableBatchActions`. When one or more rows are selected, a batch toolbar SHALL
appear with:

- "Generate PDFs" button — generates individual PDFs for each selected order
- "Download ZIP" button — generates all selected PDFs and packages them into a
  single ZIP download
- Selected count display (e.g., "3 items selected")

**LH-2-006:** Clicking "Generate PDF" on a single row SHALL immediately trigger
server-side PDF generation and initiate a browser download of the PDF file. The
filename SHALL follow the pattern:
`LHU-{certificateNumber}_{siteCode}_{labNumber}.pdf` (e.g.,
`LHU-2026-0042_SITE-042_ENV-2026-001.pdf`).

**LH-2-007:** Each row SHALL be expandable (inline row expansion) to show a
compliance summary preview before generation:

- Site name, site ID, GPS coordinates
- Standard name and version
- Collection date/time, sample types, collection method
- Compliance evaluation summary: parameter name, result, threshold, status
  (mini-table)
- E-signature status: names and timestamps of analyst and validator

**LH-2-008:** The page SHALL display a summary bar above the DataTable showing
aggregate counts: total eligible orders, how many have been generated vs. not
yet generated.

### 5.3 PDF Certificate Structure (Sertifikat Hasil Uji)

emphasized — bold text and a marker symbol (e.g., "✗") in the Status column.
PASS results use a checkmark ("✓"). MARGINAL results use a warning symbol ("⚠").

**LH-3-007:** If any compliance evaluation was overridden (via S-05), the Status
column SHALL display the override status with an asterisk (_). A footnote at the
bottom of the results table SHALL read: "_ Status overridden by {overrideBy} on
{overrideAt}. Justification: {overrideJustification}"

**LH-3-008:** Compliance Conclusion Block — below the results table:

- **If ALL evaluations are PASS:** "Berdasarkan hasil pengujian, seluruh
  parameter memenuhi baku mutu sesuai {standardName}." / "Based on the test
  results, all parameters meet the quality standards per {standardName}."
- **If ANY evaluation is FAIL:** "Berdasarkan hasil pengujian, {N} parameter
  tidak memenuhi baku mutu sesuai {standardName}." / "Based on the test results,
  {N} parameters do not meet the quality standards per {standardName}." Followed
  by a list of non-compliant parameter names.
- **If MARGINAL but no FAIL:** "Berdasarkan hasil pengujian, seluruh parameter
  memenuhi baku mutu, namun {N} parameter mendekati batas sesuai
  {standardName}." / "Based on the test results, all parameters meet the quality
  standards, however {N} parameters are approaching limits per {standardName}."

**LH-3-009:** The conclusion text SHALL be bilingual (Indonesian primary,
English secondary) to support both domestic and international reporting needs.

### 5.4 E-Signature Integration

**LH-4-001:** The PDF footer SHALL include a dual e-signature block using data
from the existing `electronic_signature` table:

```
┌────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┐
│  Diuji oleh / Tested by:   │  Disahkan oleh / Approved: │
│                             │                            │
│  {analyst_name}             │  {validator_name}           │
│  {analyst_title}            │  {validator_title}          │
│  {entry_timestamp}          │  {validation_timestamp}     │
│                             │                            │
│  Meaning: Authored          │  Meaning: Validated and     │
│                             │  Released                   │
├─────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┤
│  — Ditandatangani secara elektronik / Electronically     │
│    Signed —                                               │
│  {Report Footer Text from config}                         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**LH-4-002:** The "Tested by" signer SHALL be determined by finding the
e-signature record with `signature_meaning = 'Authored'` associated with the
results on the order. If multiple analysts authored different results, the
system SHALL list all unique analysts.

**LH-4-003:** The "Approved by" signer SHALL be determined by finding the
e-signature record with `signature_meaning = 'Validated and Released'`
associated with the results on the order.

**LH-4-004:** If e-signatures are disabled at the site level (per the existing
e-signature spec's configuration), the signature block SHALL fall back to blank
signature lines with "Tested by:" and "Approved by:" labels for manual signing
after printing.

**LH-4-005:** The signature block SHALL include the "Electronically Signed"
indicator text per §11.50 requirements, consistent with the Report-Level
Electronic Signatures spec.

### 5.5 Batch Generation & Download

**LH-5-001:** When the user selects multiple orders and clicks "Download ZIP,"
the system SHALL:

1. Generate individual PDF certificates for each selected order (server-side)
2. Package all PDFs into a single ZIP archive
3. Initiate browser download of the ZIP file
4. Log each generation individually in the audit trail

**LH-5-002:** The ZIP filename SHALL follow the pattern:
`Laporan_Hasil_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{count}certificates.zip`

**LH-5-003:** During batch generation, the UI SHALL display a progress indicator
(Carbon `Loading` or `ProgressBar`) showing N of M certificates generated.

**LH-5-004:** If any individual PDF generation fails during batch processing,
the system SHALL continue generating remaining certificates, include a
`_ERRORS.txt` file in the ZIP listing failed order numbers and error reasons,
and display an `InlineNotification` (kind="warning") after download.

### 5.6 Audit Trail

**LH-6-001:** Every PDF generation event SHALL create an immutable audit record
containing:

| Field              | Value                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event type         | `COMPLIANCE_REPORT_GENERATED`                                  |
| Order ID           | The order for which the certificate was generated              |
| Certificate number | The assigned sequential certificate number                     |
| Generated by       | Username of the user who triggered generation                  |
| Generated at       | Timestamp                                                      |
| File hash          | SHA-256 hash of the generated PDF (for integrity verification) |

**LH-6-002:** The "Last Generated" column in the DataTable SHALL display the
timestamp from the most recent audit record for that order.

**LH-6-003:** Previously generated certificates SHALL be re-generable at any
time. Each generation creates a new audit record. The certificate number remains
the same for re-generations of the same order (it is assigned on first
generation and reused).

SamplingSite, ComplianceStandard, electronic_signature) but does not modify
them.

## 7a. Domain Variants (S06c, S06d)

S06 specifies the **base** Laporan Hasil compliance report — letterhead,
customer block, dates timeline, signature/verification block, page footer,
certificate-numbering, e-signature integration, and audit trail. These are the
chassis. Two **domain-specific variants** plug their own result-table shapes
into the same chassis without forking the configuration surface or the parameter
list:

| Sibling FRS                                                         | Scope                                                                                                                                                                                    | Key divergence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Files                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S06c — Environmental LHU** (`S06c-environmental-lhu-frs-v1.0.md`) | Environmental samples — water (air minum, air limbah), food (pangan/makanan), ambient air (udara ruang), surface swabs (usap), physical conditions (pencahayaan, kebisingan, kelembaban) | Result table columns `No. \| Parameter \| Hasil Uji \| Baku Mutu \| Satuan \| Ket.` (Metode column dropped; methods in compact footnote). Multi-matrix bundling supported. KAN per-parameter asterisk; methods + accreditation coverage as compact footnote. | `S06c-environmental-lhu-preview.html`, `S06c-environmental-lhu-preview-annotated.html`, `S06c-environmental-lhu-mockup.jsx` |
| **S06d — Vector LHU** (`S06d-vector-lhu-frs-v1.0.md`)               | Vector surveillance — mosquito species ID via PCR, larval/imago surveys, infection indices (DBD, malaria, JE)                                                                            | Three flexible result-table modes: A (Species ID), B (Surveillance Indices: MIR, infection rate, density, positive*resolution*%), C (Larval Population Indices: House/Container/Breteau Index, Angka Bebas Jentik). Multi-LHU number bundling supported.     | `S06d-vector-lhu-preview.html`, `S06d-vector-lhu-preview-annotated.html`, `S06d-vector-lhu-mockup.jsx`                      |

**Inheritance principle.** Both variants reuse — without redefining — the
patient-report-redesign printed-report config: `headerName`,
`accreditationImage`, `accreditationNumber`, `accreditationLogoPosition`
(TOP/BOTTOM, default BOTTOM). The
`Admin → General Configuration → Printed Reports Configuration` page from
patient-report-spec §15 + addendum r5 §15.6 controls layout for **all** Laporan
Hasil variants identically. No new config keys are introduced.

**Annotated bilingual sibling previews.** Each variant ships two HTML previews:
the canonical Indonesian-only version (production output, matches real Labkesmas
convention) and an `*-annotated.html` sibling with bilingual column headers,
hover tooltips, and an inline glossary panel — devel-only aid for non-Indonesian
reviewers, hidden on print.

**Research artifact.** `S06-lhu-crosswalk-raw.md` — bucketing + crosswalk of 37
real LHU sample PDFs (10 environmental, 1 vector, 22 clinical-skipped) collected
from Indonesian Labkesmas. Used as the evidence base for both S06c and S06d
field/column choices.

## 8. UI Design

See companion React mockup: `S06-laporan-hasil-mockup.jsx`

### Navigation Paths

- **Reports → Laporan Hasil** — Report generation page (new menu entry)
- **Admin → Report Configuration** — Shared print configuration page (new menu
  entry)

### Key Screens

1. **Report Generation Page** — DataTable with filters, batch select, inline
   expansion preview, Generate PDF / Download ZIP actions
2. **Report Print Configuration** — Admin settings page with grouped form
   fields: Lab Identity, Accreditation, Page Layout, Numbering. Uses Accordion
   sections with inline editing.

### Interaction Patterns

- **DataTable with batch selection** for multi-order generation
- **Inline row expansion** showing compliance summary preview before generation
- **Accordion sections** on admin config page grouping related settings
- **File upload** for logo images with preview thumbnail
- **Progress indicator** during batch generation
- **InlineNotification** for success/warning/error feedback

---

## 9. Business Rules

**BR-001:** An order becomes eligible for Laporan Hasil generation only when ALL
results are validated and released AND all compliance evaluations have a
non-PENDING status. Orders with partially validated results do not appear in the
eligible list.

**BR-002:** Certificate numbers are assigned on first generation and follow the
pattern `{prefix}-{YYYY}-{NNNN}` where NNNN is a zero-padded sequential number
per calendar year. The prefix comes from Report Print Configuration
(`report.config.certificatePrefix`, default "LHU"). Re-generating the same order
reuses its certificate number.

**BR-003:** The compliance conclusion text on the PDF uses the **effective**
compliance status — if an evaluation was overridden (via S-05), the override
status is used, not the original auto-evaluation.

**BR-004:** The results table on the PDF is ordered by parameter group, then by
test name within each group. Parameter group headers appear as sub-headings.

**BR-005:** The PDF uses bilingual labels (Indonesian primary / English
secondary) for all section headers and the compliance conclusion. Result values,
parameter names, and units are not translated — they are scientific notation.

**BR-006:** If Report Print Configuration has not been completed (lab name is
empty), PDF generation SHALL be blocked with an error: "Report configuration
incomplete. Please configure lab identity at Admin → Report Configuration before
generating certificates."

**BR-007:** The e-signature block uses data from the `electronic_signature`
table. If e-signatures are disabled site-wide, the block renders blank signature
lines for manual signing. If e-signatures are enabled but a specific result
lacks a signature record, the block shows "Pending signature" for that role.

**BR-008:** Each PDF generation event is logged. The audit record includes a
SHA-256 hash of the PDF content for integrity verification. This supports ISO
17025 traceability requirements.

**BR-009:** Batch generation is limited to 50 orders per request to prevent
server resource exhaustion. The UI disables the batch action when more than 50
rows are selected and displays a helper message.

**BR-010:** Report Print Configuration changes are NOT retroactive — they only
affect PDFs generated after the change. This is intentional: previously issued
certificates represent the lab's identity at the time of issue.
